Felipe Elorrieta López is a statistical engineer
from Universidad de Santiago, Santiago, Chile,
received in 2011, M.S. degree in statistics from
Pontificia Universidad Católica, Santiago, Chile,
received in 2013, Ph.D. degree in statistics from
Pontificia Universidad Católica, Santiago, Chile,
received in 2018. From 2014 he is part of the
Millennium Astrophysics Institute (MAS). In
addition, he is also a member of the team that
implements the ALeRCE broker from 2018, as a
time series advisor. He is currently an Associate
Professor in the Faculty of Science, Department
of Mathematics and Computer Science at
Universidad de Santiago, Chile. His research
interests are the analysis of time series data and the statistical methods used in classification
problems.
Felipe Elorrieta López has worked on the classification and modeling of astronomical time
series. In 2016 he implemented a classifier to detect RR Lyrae objects in the VVV survey. In
addition, he also worked in developing new models to fit unequally spaced time series. From
these works, the irregular autoregressive model (IAR model) and the complex irregular
autoregressive model (CIAR model) were introduced. His findings were published both in the
Astronomy \&amp; Astrophysics and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society journals.
He teaches at the Faculty of Science, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science,
Universidad de Santiago, Chile since 2013. Among the courses he has taught are: Introduction
to Time Series Analysis, Analysis of Financial Time Series, Numerical Methods of Statistics and
Algorithms in Data Mining. Since 2013 he has guided more than 25 research thesis of
undergraduate students of Statistical Engineering.
